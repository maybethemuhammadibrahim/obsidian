### **Why Do We Need Both a Copy Constructor and an Assignment Operator?**

#### **1. Copy Constructor**
- The **copy constructor** is used when you **create a new object as a copy of an existing object**. For example:
  ```cpp
  Post post1("Title", "Content");
  Post post2 = post1;  // Copy constructor is called here
  ```
- The copy constructor ensures that the new object (`post2`) is a **deep copy** of the existing object (`post1`). This means it copies all the data, including dynamically allocated memory (like the `comments` array in the `Post` class).

#### **2. Assignment Operator**
- The **assignment operator** is used when you **assign an existing object to another existing object**. For example:
  ```cpp
  Post post1("Title", "Content");
  Post post2;
  post2 = post1;  // Assignment operator is called here
  ```
- The assignment operator ensures that the object on the left-hand side (`post2`) is updated to be a **deep copy** of the object on the right-hand side (`post1`). It also handles cleaning up any existing resources in the left-hand object before copying.

### **Line-by-Line Explanation of the Assignment Operator**

Here’s the assignment operator for the `Post` class, with explanations for each line:

```cpp
Post& operator=(const Post& other) {
    // 1. Check for self-assignment (e.g., post1 = post1)
    if (this != &other) {
        // 2. Delete existing resources to avoid memory leaks
        delete[] comments;

        // 3. Copy non-pointer members
        title = other.title;
        content = other.content;
        noOfComments = other.noOfComments;

        // 4. Allocate new memory for the comments array
        comments = new Comment[noOfComments];

        // 5. Copy the contents of the other object's comments array
        for (int i = 0; i < noOfComments; i++) {
            comments[i] = other.comments[i];
        }
    }

    // 6. Return the current object to allow chaining (e.g., post1 = post2 = post3)
    return *this;
}
```

---

#### **1. Check for Self-Assignment**
```cpp
if (this != &other) {
```
- **Purpose**: This checks if the object is being assigned to itself (e.g., `post1 = post1`).
- **Why**: If you don’t check for self-assignment, the next step (`delete[] comments`) would delete the memory that you’re trying to copy, leading to undefined behavior.

---

#### **2. Delete Existing Resources**
```cpp
delete[] comments;
```
- **Purpose**: This deletes the existing `comments` array in the current object (`this`).
- **Why**: If the object already has a `comments` array, we need to free its memory to avoid a memory leak.

---

#### **3. Copy Non-Pointer Members**
```cpp
title = other.title;
content = other.content;
noOfComments = other.noOfComments;
```
- **Purpose**: This copies the non-pointer members (`title`, `content`, and `noOfComments`) from the `other` object to the current object (`this`).
- **Why**: These members are simple values (not dynamically allocated), so we can copy them directly.

---

#### **4. Allocate New Memory**
```cpp
comments = new Comment[noOfComments];
```
- **Purpose**: This allocates a new `comments` array for the current object (`this`).
- **Why**: We need a new array to hold the copied comments, so we don’t share memory with the `other` object.

---

#### **5. Copy the Contents of the Comments Array**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < noOfComments; i++) {
    comments[i] = other.comments[i];
}
```
- **Purpose**: This copies each `Comment` object from the `other` object’s `comments` array to the current object’s `comments` array.
- **Why**: This ensures that the `comments` array is a **deep copy**, not just a shared pointer.

---

#### **6. Return the Current Object**
```cpp
return *this;
```
- **Purpose**: This returns the current object (`*this`) to allow **chaining** of assignments (e.g., `post1 = post2 = post3`).
- **Why**: By returning `*this`, you can write code like `post1 = post2 = post3`, which assigns `post3` to `post2` and then `post2` to `post1`.

---

### **Example Use Case**

Here’s how the assignment operator works in practice:

```cpp
Post post1("Title1", "Content1");
post1.addComment(Comment("Great post!"));

Post post2;
post2 = post1;  // Assignment operator is called here

post1.display();  // Output: Title1, Content1, Comments: Great post!
post2.display();  // Output: Title1, Content1, Comments: Great post!
```

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Copy Constructor**:
   - Used when **creating a new object as a copy of an existing object**.
   - Ensures a **deep copy** of all data, including dynamically allocated memory.

2. **Assignment Operator**:
   - Used when **assigning one existing object to another**.
   - Ensures a **deep copy** while also cleaning up existing resources in the left-hand object.

3. **Why Both Are Needed**:
   - The copy constructor handles object creation, while the assignment operator handles object assignment.
   - Without both, you risk memory leaks, double deletion, or shared memory between objects.
