Perfect — you're at that point where moving from **combinational logic** to **sequential logic** is crucial, especially for building a working **Shift-and-Add Multiplier**. Sequential logic allows you to store data, manage steps, and move between operations — exactly what your multiplier needs.

Here’s a **structured, project-focused roadmap** to mastering **memory units in DLD** (Digital Logic Design) — curated for **Logisim + deep understanding + minimal premade ICs**.

## 🧭 PHASED ROADMAP: Learning Sequential Memory Units for Your Project

---

### 🟨 **PHASE 1: Understand the Core Concept**
Before diving into flip-flops or registers:

- 🔹 **Combinational vs Sequential Circuits**
  - Combinational: Output depends only on current inputs
  - Sequential: Output depends on **current input + past input (stored using memory)**

- 🔹 **Clock Signal**
  - Drives updates in memory units
  - Learn about **rising edge**, **falling edge**, and **level triggering**

- 🔹 **Bit vs Byte Storage**
  - Memory units store bits, registers store bytes (8 bits or more)

---

### 🟩 **PHASE 2: Master Flip-Flops (1-bit memory cells)**

These are **fundamental building blocks** of sequential circuits.

#### 🔹 What to Learn First:
- What a **flip-flop** is
- The **clock input**, and how edge triggering works
- The concept of **Set/Reset**, **Enable**, and **Toggle**

#### 🔹 Common Types of Flip-Flops:

| Flip-Flop | Symbol | Description | Usage |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **SR Flip-Flop** | Set/Reset | Stores 1 (Set) or 0 (Reset) | Foundation for all flip-flops |
| **D Flip-Flop** | Data/Delay | Output follows input at clock edge | Most commonly used in registers |
| **T Flip-Flop** | Toggle | Toggles output on clock edge | Counters |
| **JK Flip-Flop** | Jack-Kilby | Like SR but no invalid state | Rare in basic projects |

✅ For your calculator project → **Focus on D Flip-Flop**

---

### 🟦 **PHASE 3: Learn Latches (Level-triggered memory)**

These are like flip-flops but **update based on input level**, not edge.

| Latch Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **SR Latch** | Basic Set/Reset latch |
| **D Latch** | Stores input while enabled |

🔍 D Latch = **Transparent** when enabled → Used in simpler memory units

✅ In Logisim, you'll use **D Flip-Flops** more than latches, but understanding latches is useful.

---

### 🟥 **PHASE 4: Learn Registers (Multi-bit memory storage)**

Registers are **groups of flip-flops** used to store bytes.

#### 🔹 Register Types:

| Register Type | Description | Use in Your Project |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Simple Register** | 8 D flip-flops | Store multiplicand, multiplier, result |
| **Shift Register** | Can shift bits left/right | Critical for Shift-and-Add Multiplier |
| **Parallel Load Register** | Load all bits at once | Needed for clean input |
| **Serial In/Out** | One bit at a time | Rare in your context, but helpful conceptually |

✅ Learn how to:
- Load a value into a register
- Shift contents (Left Shift Register)
- Connect outputs to adder
- Use **enable** and **clock**

---

### 🟧 **PHASE 5: Apply to Project**

Here’s where you’ll **tie theory to your calculator**:

| Component | Memory Unit Type | Purpose |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Multiplicand Register** | 8-bit Shift Register | Shift left every step |
| **Multiplier Register** | 8-bit Right Shift Register | Check LSB each step, shift right |
| **Accumulator Register** | 8-bit Register | Stores sum result |
| **Control Counter** | 3-bit Counter (made from T or D FFs) | Loop for 8 cycles |

---

### 🟨 **PHASE 6: Learn Counters & FSMs (optional but useful)**

These aren’t memory *units* per se, but help in **managing steps**:

- **Binary Counters** (3-bit for 8 steps)
  - Use T or D Flip-Flops
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** (optional)
  - Handles the logic of when to add, when to shift, when to stop

---

## 🧠 Extras You Should Know (Highly Recommended)

| Concept | Why It's Important |
|--------|--------------------|
| **Enable Lines** | Prevent unwanted overwrites to registers |
| **Clock Pulses** | Controls timing of each step |
| **Debouncing** | If using buttons in final version |
| **Tri-State Buffers** | For bus control (advanced, optional) |
| **Memory Timing Diagrams** | Helps visualize data flow and control |

| Phase | Focus | Priority |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Combinational vs Sequential + Clock | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| 2 | D Flip-Flop + clock edge behavior | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| 3 | Latches (SR & D) | ⭐️⭐️ |
| 4 | Registers + Shift Registers | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| 5 | Use in Multiplier: A, B, Result | ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
| 6 | Optional: FSM / Counter | ⭐️⭐️⭐️ |
